				<h2>From Science to Tech</h2>
				<p>
					I Worked as a clinical research coordinator in the flagship study for the center with A team of research coordinators that helped runs thproject. I worked mostly on the back-end while others worked on scheduling, testing, and entering data. The study takes in up to 35 participants a month, with each visit lasting one week, producing thousands of data points each. I enjoyed my work and dove into exciting scientific concepts, but I found myself performing monotonous tasks that I knew a computer could do. Learning to use bash and matlab for work with imaging data, and only basic undergraduate experience in javascript and web-design, I thought I would learn more about programming to make my job more efficient. I ended automated every possible aspect of my job and took on new responsibilities after a team member resigned.
				<br/><br/>
					Though I love science, especially biology and neurology, my most significant contributions to the study ended up coming out of text editors, and I realized that coding was an effective way to help people. Not only did I make my co-workers lives easier, I was helping our research participants recieve better care. I found that I enjoyed my work most when I was developing new tools.
					<br/><br/>
					After much consideration, I decided to pursue this field to learn how to produce professional work and explore advanced techniques.
