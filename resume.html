				<h2>From Science to Tech</h2>
				<p>
					I worked as a clinical research coordinator on the flagship study for our center with a team of other coordinators. I was mostly responsible for the back-end while others worked on scheduling, testing, and entering data. The study was in a period of rapid growth and took in up to 35 participants a month, with each visit lasting one week and generating thousands of data points each. I enjoyed my work and dove into exciting scientific concepts, but I found myself performing monotonous tasks that I knew a computer could do. These tasks only grew with the increasing number of visits. After beginning to use bash and matlab for imaging data, I wanted to learn more about programming to make my job more efficient. I ended up automating every possible aspect, freeing up enough time to take on new responsibilites when the senior team leader resigned.
					<br/><br/>
					Though I love science, especially biology and neurology, my most significant contributions to the study ended up coming out of text editors, and I realized that coding was an effective way to help people. Not only did I make my co-workers lives easier, I was helping our research participants recieve better care. Aside from the practical implications, I enjoyed my work most when I was developing new tools.
					<br/><br/>
					After much consideration, I decided to pursue this field to learn how to produce professional work and explore advanced techniques.
