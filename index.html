				<h2>From Science to Tech</h2>
				<p>
					I worked for two years as a Clinical Research Coordinator on the flagship study for the UCSF Memory and Aging Center (a global leader in neurodegenerative disease research, treatment, and clinical care). As the study moved through a period of rapid growth, taking in up to 35 participants a month (each visit lasting one week, generating thousands of data points each), I found myself performing more and more monotonous tasks that I knew a computer could do. After beginning to use bash and matlab for imaging data, I wanted to learn more about how programming could make our study more efficient. I ended up teaching myself, automating every possible aspect I could along the way. After that, I had had enough time to take on new responsibilites when the senior team leader resigned.
					<br/><br/>
					I also developed a new management system for research visist summaries (see <a href="https://github.com/fonsecapeter/jarvs">Jarvs</a> in my portfolio for more information). Jarvs ended up being adopeted by another large study in the center, which felt so rewarding. Not only did I make my co-workers lives easier, I was helping our research participants recieve better care.
					<br/><br/>
					While working on these projects, I realized that I my greatest services to the study came through programming. Incidentally, I enjoyed this work so much more. After much consideration, I decided that I wanted to become a programmer and continue to learn how I could leverage technology to help others.
